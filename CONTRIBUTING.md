# CONTRIBUTING
> Contributions are welcome!

If you know a no-auth public API that isnâ€™t listed, feel free to open a Pull Request.

### How to Contribute
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b AmazingAPI`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingAPI'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin AmazingAPI`)
5. Submit a pull request

### Guidelines
- Only include **public APIs that do not require authentication**.
- Keep descriptions concise (one line, no marketing fluff).
- Verify the API is online and working before submitting.
- Place the API under the correct category in alphabetical order.
- If unsure, open an [Issue](https://github.com/ecnivs/noauthapis/issues) first.
